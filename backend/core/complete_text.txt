Sandalwood is a class of woods from trees in the genus Santalum. The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and, unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods for use. Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world. Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries.

Sandalwood Cultivation can fetch you approximately Rs. 2.5 to 3 lakhs starting from one tree as per previously recorded Government Auction Data. Let’s Understand the methods of Sandalwood farming from a broader prospect.

The Government has banned the free trading of sandalwood. In such situations, only the government can buy it. According to the Constitutional amendments made in 2017, farmers can only cultivate sandalwood. But only the Government reserves the right to export.

The best part about Sandalwood plantation is that it is absolutely low maintenance and does not require much watering. Hence it is important to consider the fact that, they should not be planted in low-lying areas. It is also necessary to grow host plants alongside sandalwood plantations that support the growth of sandalwood because it is a parasitic plant which cannot survive alone.

Now the concern arises, why is it necessary to have a host plant? The justification is quite simple, the roots of the host plant meet the sandalwood roots and only then the sandalwood can grow rapidly. Farmers can plant host plants at a distance of 2 to 3 feet from sandalwood plants. There are many different types of Host plants but we recommend planting two high-quality developed pomegranate plants along with each sandalwood from a commercial point of view.

For Example- If we plant 2 host plants for each sandalwood tree it means that we need to plant about 1200 pomegranate saplings on 1-acre land. After the ripening season If we can get 10 kgs of pomegranate from each plant, the total production from 1 acre is approximately 12000 Kg of Pomegranate. Hence, considering the market value of 1 kg pomegranate to be Rs 50, one can easily earn about 6 lakhs from 1 Acre of land after a year. 

Sandalwood trees can be planted throughout the year. But while planting it is important to keep in mind that. the temperature of the location should be approx 30 degrees Celsius or more because Sandalwood requires hot and humid weather conditions to grow in full bloom. The advantage of this is that it can be planted during any season, and it will not spoil.

After planting the sandalwood trees, special care needs to be taken for cleanliness around it. Along with this, water accumulation should also not be encouraged around its roots. The core reason to avoid planting them in low-lying areas. To avoid the accumulation of water during the rainy season, keep its weir slightly above so that the accumulation of water does not affect the roots. Sandalwood plants need 2 to 3 litres of water a week.

Sandalwood is mostly used in perfumes. Sandalwood is widely used in Ayurveda. It is also prepared in liquid and dust form for beauty and skincare. Sandalwood oil has a warm, woody odour and is commonly used as a fragrance in incense, cosmetics, perfumes, and soaps. It also is used as a flavour for foods and beverages. Sandalwood has been valued in carving because of its dense character. Sandalwood oil has been reported to have diuretic and urinary antiseptic properties, but clinical trial data are lacking. The oil has mainly been used as a fragrance enhancer. Sandalwood Oil has been a key component in the making of attar since ancient times.

Good quality sandalwood plants can be available to farmers ranging from Rs 300 onwards. Apart from this, the cost of the host plant attached to it is around 90 to 125 rupees. Sandalwood is considered to be the most expensive wood. Its market price is around Rs.26,000 to 30,000 per kg. Let us suppose that one tree is about 100 kg in weight, it can easily be broken down to fetch 10 Kg of hardwood and 90 Kg is sapwood in about 15-20 years. Sapwood, on the other hand, can also be sold at Rs. 1000-1200 per kg, which equals to an annual turnover of approximately 

There are two types of sandalwood – White & Red Sandalwood are the two types. White sandalwood is cultivated in the major parts of Northern India as it requires a 7.5 pH level of the soil. On the other hand, red sandalwood trees require soil with a pH level of 4.5 to 6.5. Hence, Red sandalwood is cultivated in Southern parts of India. Sandalwood trees cannot be grown in sandy and snowy regions.

Sandalwood tree farming has gained huge popularity because of the high fragrance of sandalwood or Chandan, and its wood materials have been used for centuries. Sandalwood trees, majorly known as Sandalwood or Srigandha, are considered the most expensive tree plants. Sandalwood is an evergreen tree primarily used in commercial, therapeutic, cosmetic, and medicinal applications. The maximum height of a sandalwood tree ranges between 13 to 16 meters, with a girth of about 100 to 200 cm. These sandalwood trees are found in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Australia, Pakistan, Hawaii, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands.

Sandalwood trees belong to the Santalaceae family and have the scientific name Santalum Album. Chandan trees hold a significant place in Indian tradition and are used by Indian people throughout their lives, from cradle to cremation. They are also used in the pharmaceutical, aromatherapy, cosmetics, perfumery, and soap industries. Due to their extensive uses, the commercial value of sandalwood trees or oil is exceptionally high in the Indian market. Numerous varieties of sandalwood exist worldwide, but Indian Sandalwood and Australian Sandalwood are the most commercially valuable. Additionally, the leaves of the sandalwood tree are used as animal fodder.

After 30 years of cultivation, sandalwood trees are ready for harvesting. However, by employing organic cultivation methods, sandalwood trees can mature within 10 to 15 years. In India, sandalwood is available in two colors: white, yellow, and red. One advantage of Chandan tree farming is that these trees can also be grown as an intercrop in Malabar Neem plantations.

Farmers or investors planning for sandalwood tree cultivation need proper soil, land, climate, plant selection, irrigation, and fertilizers. Proper project planning, including calculating profits and expenses and determining the required investment, is essential before starting the cultivation.

Sandalwood trees can thrive in almost every type of soil, temperature, and climate. A hot atmosphere is necessary for sandalwood farming, as these trees thrive better in humid climatic conditions. An optimal temperature range of 12 to 35 degrees Celsius is required for cultivating sandalwood trees. These trees perform best at altitudes between 600 and 1050 meters.

Well-drained soils with good organic content are necessary for Chandan tree farming. Red sandy loam soils are especially suitable for sandalwood cultivation, ensuring a high-yield crop. A soil test is essential to check the nutrient content and pH, which should ideally range from 6.5 to 7.5 with a slight alkalinity. Plowing the field until achieving a fine tilth and weed-free soil is required before planting. Additionally, the soil must be prepared to drain excess water during heavy rains or floods. Sandalwood cultivation can be done by seeds or vegetatively using tissue culture.

Sandalwood farms are prone to pests and diseases. Common insect pests include defoliators, Hotea nigrorufa Walker, Nyctemera lacticinia (Cramer), Calodia kirkaldyi Nielson, Cardiococcus bivalvata (Green), Hyposidra talaca Walker, Purpuricenus sanguinolentus (Olivier), Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe), Tajuria cippus (Fabricius), Trematodes monticollis (Gray), Eumeta crameri (Westwood), and Trabala vishnou (Lefèbvre). Common diseases include black spot fungal, phytoplasma, Pulvinaria psidii Mask, coccid, and Phellinus noxius.

Sowing in Chandan tree farming is primarily done using seeds. Seeds from 15 to 20-year-old Chandan trees can be collected between August and March. These seeds must be treated and dried in sunlight before sowing in nursery beds. Nursery beds are available in two types: sunken and raised. After 7 to 8 months, seedlings grow to 30 to 35 cm and become ready for transplantation to the main field. During land preparation for sandalwood cultivation, pits measuring 45*45*45 cm should be dug for planting seedlings. Care must be taken to ensure that water does not accumulate in the pits; otherwise, the pits should be exposed to sunlight for drying. A spacing of 10 feet between each plant is necessary. Sandalwood trees begin flowering four years after planting.

Farmers can purchase baby sandalwood plants from government or private nurseries or buy them online. It is important to ensure that the plants are purchased from genuine sources. The cost of a single baby plant generally ranges from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1000, but for commercial plantations, plants can be purchased at around Rs. 100 per plant from certified sources.

Sandalwood tree cultivation requires minimal water. Drip irrigation can be used every 2 to 3 weeks, especially for young plants during hot summers. Irrigation is generally unnecessary during rainy seasons.

Bio-fertilizers, chemical fertilizers, and organic fertilizers like cow dung, garden compost, vermicompost, and manure made from green leaves can be used to enhance crop yield. Bio-pesticides made from materials such as chitrakmool, neem (seeds, kernel, and leaves), dhatura, and cow urine can help control pests and diseases in sandalwood farms.

Sandalwood trees mature and are ready for harvesting after 30 years of cultivation. Various modern tree-cutting tools are available for harvesting. The heartwood of sandalwood trees is separated at the mill, and the softwood is removed. The hard sandalwood is processed into powder, which is soaked in water for two days before being used to extract oil or create other cosmetic products.

In the past, sandalwood farming was thought to be the main economic driver in Mysore, where the state's entire budget was reliant on it.

Although sandalwood farming in India has been well-known for many years, it was primarily limited to the forests and plantations of the South Indian state governments.

Nevertheless, these governments changed their stance in 2002 to allow for sandalwood farming.

To prevent a sandalwood shortage in the near future, the Karnataka State Forest Department has relaxed the rules governing sandalwood cultivation.

The Karnataka Tree Act of 1927 is being suggested to be amended, and the forest department permits people to freely own and do sandalwood cultivation.

After careful examination by the officials, permission is granted to chop down a sandalwood tree that is owned by a private individual.

When all legalities are completed, the fallen tree is brought to the sandalwood warehouse and auctioned. Private sandalwood cultivation of this priceless tree is currently expanding quickly.

Indian sandalwood is widely valued for its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is one of its main characteristics.

Sandalwood oil is used in cosmetics, aromatherapy, fragrances, and pharmaceutical preparations.

Sandalwood is a very valuable material that is utilized in carving.

Up to 6% oil and 90% of ⍶ and β santalols make up Indian sandalwood (which is claimed to be the highest).

In the worldwide markets, sandalwood is in great demand (20,000 metric tonnes and 1,000 tonnes, respectively), and the present global supply cannot keep up with this demand, which has caused sandalwood prices to skyrocket.

Growing sandalwood is a tremendously lucrative industry that requires very little upkeep. Continue reading to learn more about the cultivation process and upkeep information.

Sandalwood trees grow best in hot, humid climates seen in tropical and subtropical locations. The cultivation requires areas at fairly higher altitudes and temperatures between 12 and 40 degrees Celsius (preferably 2000 to 3500 feet above sea level).

Sandalwood is the only wood in the world that is sold by weight, and investing in its cultivation may yield enormous returns.

The top-quality sandalwood is occasionally sold for about Rs 10,000 per kilogram, with a market price range of Rs 3,000 to Rs 7,000 per kg.

The heartwood of a sandalwood tree begins to develop around the age of eight and may be harvested 12 to 15 years following planting.

Sandalwood is in great demand in both the domestic and global markets. So, investing in the growth of sandalwood will yield substantial rewards.

You might anticipate a harvest of 5000 kg of sandalwood from an acre of land. Sandalwood cultivation will cost around Rs 8 to 10 lakh per acre, but the profits might be anywhere from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore.

Sandalwood may grow in a range of soil types, including rocky hard ground, clay-rich black soil, sandy soil, and soils that are red clay-rich.

It can even withstand gravelly soil. The pH of the soil needs to fall between 6 and 7.5.

Sandalwood plants require less water to grow. Throughout the summer, the young sandalwood plants require watering once every two to three weeks.

In the event of rain, they might not need irrigation.

In sandalwood farming, seeds are mostly used for sowing. You may pick the Chandan seeds from these trees between August and March after they are 15 to 20 years old.

Before they seminate on nursery beds, the seeds you have gathered need to be well-treated and dried in the sun.

For the planting of sandalwood seeds, the nursery has two different types of seedbeds available: Sunken beds and Raised beds.

On nursery beds, a seedling can reach a height of 30 to 35 cm after 7 to 8 months. Also, they will get ready for being moved to the primary pitch.

You must concurrently excavate a trench measuring 454545 cm for the planting of sandalwood seedlings while preparing the area or soil for the cultivation of sandalwood trees.

When planting seedlings, you must make sure that water will not remain stable in pits.

If the holes contain any water, you must remove them from the sunshine for a few days. Also, you must maintain a 10-foot space between each plant.

After four years of planting, your sandalwood trees will begin to bloom.

Santalum album. Linn commonly known as East Indian sandalwood or chandan belongs to the family Santalaceae. It is highly valuable and becoming endangered species. It is distributed all over the country and more than 90% lies in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu covering 8300 sq kms.  Sandalwood plays an important role in the religious life of Indians. The essential oil obtained from this wood has occupied significant place in perfumery industries/market. Although it is available in some other countries still the Indian Sandalwood has retained its dominance over other sources because of its quality.

Sandalwood is light demanding and can be easily suppressed by faster-growing species. Cultivation of sandal in India has had limited success. Sandal trees freely produce seed and natural regeneration occurs both via seedlings and through root suckers after trees have been uprooted and the stump removed from the ground.

Sandalwood oil also known as fragrance oil, perfume oil, body oil. The oil has a woody, exotic smell, subtle and lingering and the colour is pale yellow to pale gold. The essential oil contains Alpha-santalol and beta-santalol amount to more than 90 % of the oil - making it very superior sandalwood oil. The main chemical components are santalol, santyl acetate and santalene (Bo Jensen, Denmark)

The price of Sandalwood in India is everyday increasing price Rs. 20,000 per tonne in 1980, Rs. 200,000 per tonne in 1990; Rs. 4000,000 per tonne in 2004 and 7500,000 per tonne in 2014. India uses all S. album domestically and export is prohibited (USDA, 1990). Export of timber from India is totally banned except for handicraft pieces of sandalwood up to 50g weight. FAO, 1984 notes that it is a priority species for in setup conservation. Since then, sandalwood oil and handicrafts have become more important. International demand for sandalwood is estimated to the 10,000 mt per year. USA and France are the two largest importers of Indian sandalwood oil. Imports into the Middle are increasing.

Sandal Research Centre (SRC) was carried out on wide-ranging aspects of genetics, silviculture and management of sandal, properties and utilisation. Renamed SRC as Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST), Bangalore and it has made impressive contribution.  IWST has carried out extensive research on various aspects of S. album like; survey, morphology, tree improvement, soils, silviculture, physiology, biotechnology, diseases and pests, chemistry and utilization, Production and export management, etc. In Indian sandalwood, all research related materiel is in print form but not in the electronic media, which is very essential.

To encourage sandalwood cultivation, the Karnataka Forests Act, Tamil Nadu Forests Act, Kerala Forests Act and Andhra Pradesh forests Act have been amended. The ownership of sandalwood trees grown on private lands now vests with the landowners. The rules governing felling, transport, conservation and disposal of sandalwood have been liberalized. Provision has been made for payment of market value to owner of sandalwood trees.

Conservation action for economically important sandalwood of India needs to be guided by an authentic knowledge base on such plant species. Such a knowledge base is visualized as a well-designed computerized web database providing quick access to some of the most important basic information relating to S. album  tree e.g. distribution, morphology, tree improvement, soils, silviculture, physiology, biotechnology, diseases and pests, chemistry and utilization, Production and export management, etc.  Such a database needs to be developed to incorporate proper description of each of these valuable properties of S. album. This Monograph database forms promoting informed conservation action for prioritized sandalwood yielding and also act as a platform for initiating other focused research projects relating to the management of this valuable endanger species.

Five years ago, farmer K C Dinesh planted 2,500 sandalwood saplings on four hectares of his land in Karnataka’s Chitradurga district. In 10 years, he expects to earn Rs 12-Rs 15 crore from his crop. “Farmers from the entire district are visiting my farm. Everybody wants to plant sandalwood as it is highly profitable and needs least maintenance,” he says.

Although India has long been known for its sandalwood (Santalum album), it is only in the past decade that farmers have shown interest in growing the plant in their backyard. Until 2000, sandalwood was largely confined to the forests of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala and plantations of these state governments. There was no cultivation on private agricultural land in the rest of the country. But a policy change in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in 2001 and 2002 respectively allowed people to grow sandalwood. This inspired other states.

In the past four years, 2,800 ha of agricultural land came under sandalwood cultivation in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Uttarakhand, apart from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The figure is rising by approximately 600 ha per year, according to an estimate by the Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST), Bengaluru, a pioneering institute for sandalwood research. This will help revive the country’s lost glory in the sandalwood trade.

India was once a world leader in sandalwood production. In the 1960s, it produced almost 4,000 tonnes of sandalwood. This is significant given the international demand—6,000-7,000 tonnes per annum. But smuggling became rampant due to the wood’s high value and demand in the market. Thefts gradually decimated the sandalwood forests.

Sandalwood is in high demand in countries like India, China, Japan, Taiwan, and the US. But the current production across the world accounts for only one-fourth of the global market demand. Short supply and high demand has led to a steep rise in sandalwood prices, particularly during 2002-07.

India, which once produced about 80 percent of the world's sandalwood and oil, today annually produces about 400 tonnes of its native variety, Santalum album. Honolulu in the Pacific Islands was known for its abundance of sandalwood, but excessive logging has depleted the number of trees. Overexploitation has damaged the wood in Fiji, while there is a ban on sandalwood extraction in Indonesia. Malaysia has only recently started plantation, so its production will take time.

Australia today is the only significant global producer of sandalwood, with 9,000 hectares of plantation. Although its native variety, Santalumspicatum, is facing a decline, the country took up plantation of the Indian variety decades back, which is now ready for harvest. As of 2014, India has 20,725 ha of sandalwood plantation, but it could be a decade or more before the country can harvest any of it as the sandalwood plants are still very young.

A 1792 edict by Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the kingdom of Mysore, added to the problem. Under the edict, sandalwood was declared a royal tree. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu later adopted the edict and kept sandalwood under government control. But this did more harm than good as many legal obligations were imposed on sandalwood cultivation. “Having a sandalwood tree in your backyard or farm was more of a hassle than benefit. You had no rights of ownership, but if your tree got stolen you were in trouble with the authorities. So people started distancing themselves from the tree,” explains IWST head V Ramakantha.

These factors affected the country’s sandalwood production, which started going downhill since the 1990s. According to official data, India currently produces about 400 tonnes of sandalwood annually. There is an end of monopoly of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the valuable wood, and other states are keen to take up cultivation. Ramakantha says cultivation on private land is crucial for reviving India’s vibrant sandalwood trade. “Apart from raising national production, private cultivation will benefit farmers as sandalwood is the most economically rewarding crop in the world,” Ramakantha says. In recent years, the Karnataka government has made further provisions to encourage sandalwood cultivation. In 2009, the state simplified its laws so that instead of monopoly procurement by the forest department, growers could sell their wood directly to semi-government corporations such as Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation (KSHDC) and Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL). Recently, the government also announced a 75 percent subsidy on sandalwood cultivation.

The benefits of the crop to a producer are stupendous. After the age of seven to eight years, the heartwood of a sandalwood tree grows by 1 kg every year, and its market price is between Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,000 per kg. It is the only wood in the world to be sold by weight. According to IWST estimates, the cost of sandalwood cultivation per hectare is about Rs 30 lakh for the entire crop cycle, but the returns vary from Rs 1.2 crore to Rs 1.5 crore. IWST recommends a 15-year harvest cycle of sandalwood for maximum benefit.

Since 2001, IWST has been working steadily to devise cultivation protocols for the crop. IWST has developed protocols for uniform germination, disease control, and tissue culture propagation. It has also identified companion crops or hosts of sandalwood. Being a hemiparasite, sandalwood requires macronutrients from the roots of other plants. Now, the institute has a complete set of instructions for farmers wanting to cultivate sandalwood. It says that around 350 sandalwood seedlings should be planted per acre (0.4 ha) with 150 host plants. Mimosa pudica, commonly known as touch-me-not, has been identified as the best host for the initial development of the seedling, while pigeon-pea and fruits like sapodilla, papaya, and pomegranate make good hosts at a later stage.

“Unlike monoculture plantations where the waiting period yields no results at all, in sandalwood, a farmer can get an income from the host plants for seven to eight years, after which they wither and a pure sandalwood plantation remains,” Ramakantha explains. IWST proposes organic management of the crop, as it is not found to respond well to chemical inputs. This is an added benefit as the soil is protected and cultivation costs are low. The institute also provides seedlings to farmers at a nominal cost of Rs 40 per plant.

Despite a growth in cultivation, it will be difficult for India to regain its leadership position in global sandalwood trade anytime soon. In fact, growers are unable to meet the domestic demand.

“There is a big demand for pure sandalwood incense sticks that we produce,” says Keshav Murthy, managing director at KSDL, the largest manufacturer of sandalwood oil and its products in India. “But due to the shortfall in production, their space is taken up by imported raw sticks from Vietnam.”

The main reason for this shortfall is that India’s sandalwood plantations are still young and the waiting period is long.

G S Kariappa, managing director of KSHDC, says that although restrictions on sale in the state were lifted in 2009, very few farmers are approaching his organisation for selling their produce because they do not have mature wood to sell. “Technically, a tree has a viable quantity of heartwood at 15 years, but the mature quality that can fetch the best price takes time to form,” he says, and adds that harvest should take place only after 25-30 years.

G Venkatappa, a farmer in Kelchennahlli village in Kolar district, Karnataka, started a 0.8 ha sandalwood plantation 18 months ago. He says other farmers in his village are impressed with the prospective benefits, but no one has followed suit because of the long waiting period.

Another concern is security. “Protecting a sandalwood plantation is a tough task for a farmer. It attracts theft once the trees are ready for harvest. If the government provides help in the form of police protection, cameras and so on, more farmers might be willing to take up cultivation,” says M Gopal, chairperson, All-India Kisan Council.

Farmers cultivating sandalwood need to invest heavily in protection equipment. Dinesh has developed a natural fence of thorny acacia trees, installed a solar fence and even carried out trenching all around his farm. He is also planning to install CCTV cameras once his trees become mature. “It is an expensive prospect, but I hope the returns will make up for the cost,” he says.

Ramakantha believes policy provisions supporting sandalwood-cultivating farmers will encourage more production. “Only government and its agencies should be allowed to procure sandalwood from farmers. This provision will prevent them from being cheated or bullied by unscrupulous traders. The government can enter into purchase contracts with farmers and provide security, since the trees would then be government property,” he adds.

Today, the market for sandalwood in India looks favorable. Farmers, too, have the technical know-how to start their own cultivation. But the country still has a long way to go to regain its position as the world leader in sandalwood production.

Sandalwood was once considered as the primary source of Mysore state economy where the entire budget was planned based on sandalwood.

Although India has been known for its sandalwood production for decades, it was largely confined to the forests of South Indian states and the plantations of these state governments. But, a policy change by these governments in 2002 allowed people to grow sandalwood. The Karnataka State Forest Department has liberalized the regulations related to sandalwood cultivation to ensure that there is no shortage of sandalwood in the coming future. As per the proposed amendment to the Karnataka Tree Act 1927, the forest department allows individuals to freely grow and own sandalwood trees.

Permission is given to cut a sandalwood tree in private ownership after thorough inspection by the officials. The felled tree is transported to the sandalwood depot and is auctioned after completing necessary formalities. And now, the private cultivation of this precious tree is rapidly increasing.

Key Features of Indian Sandalwood – Indian Sandalwood is highly prized due to its aromatic fragrant wood. – The oil extracted from sandalwood is used in perfumes, cosmetics, aromatherapy and medicinal preparations. – Sandalwood is an extremely precious element and is used for carving. – Indian sandalwood consists of up to 6% oil and around 90% if α and β santalols (which is claimed to be the highest).

Sandalwood is in high demand (about 20,000 metric tons and oil 1000 tons) in the international markets and the current production across the world does not meet this demand which has led to a drastic rise in the sandalwood price. Sandalwood cultivation is a highly profitable business which needs very minimal maintenance. To know more about the cultivation process and maintenance details, read on…

If you are looking to invest in sandalwood cultivation, then you need the right climate, land, soil and irrigation system for the healthy growth of the trees. You must plan out the complete process in advance, in order to get high ROI (Return on Investment).

Climate Requirement Sandalwood trees thrive well in the tropical and sub-tropical regions where the climate is hot & humid. The cultivation requires temperatures ranging from 12 degree to 40 degree Celsius and lands at reasonably higher altitudes (preferably 2000 to 3500 feet above sea level).

Soil Requirement Sandalwood can grow in a variety of soil types including red clay soils, sandy soils and clay-rich black soils and can tolerate gravelly soil and rocky hard ground. The soil pH should range between 6 and 7.5.

Irrigation Cultivating sandalwood plants requires less water. The young sandalwood plants need to be provided with irrigation once in 2 to 3 weeks during summer. However, they may not require irrigation in rainy conditions.

Harvesting The sandalwood cultivation profit to an investor is tremendous and it’s the only wood in the world to be sold by weight. Its market price ranges between Rs 3,000 and Rs 7,000 per kg, with the top-quality sandalwood sometimes sold at around Rs 10,000 per kg. Once a sandalwood tree is eight years old, the heartwood of the tree starts to form and is ready to be harvested after 12 to 15 years from planting. Both in the local and international market, there is a huge demand for sandalwood. So, you are sure to get high returns from sandalwood cultivation.

From an acre of land, you can expect a yield of 5000 kg of sandalwood. The cost of sandalwood cultivation would approximately be around Rs 8 to 10 lakh per acre, but the returns can range between Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore.

Santalum album, commonly known as East Indian sandalwood or chandan, belongs to the family Santalaceae. It is highly valuable and is becoming an endangered species. It is distributed throughout India, with more than 90% of its presence found in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, covering an area of 8,300 square kilometers. Sandalwood plays an important role in the religious life of Indians. The essential oil extracted from this wood holds a significant place in the perfumery industry. While available in other countries, Indian sandalwood retains its dominance over other sources due to its superior quality.

Santalum album occurs in coastal dry forests up to an elevation of 700 meters. It typically grows in sandy or stony red soils, though it can inhabit a wide range of soil types. The habitat has a temperature range from 0°C to 38°C, with annual rainfall varying between 500 and 3,000 mm.

Santalum album is an evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height and reach a girth of over 1.5 meters. It flowers and fruits twice a year, during March-April and September-October. Trees begin flowering at the age of 3, with seed production typically good in one of the two seasons. However, some trees flower only once a year or irregularly. Approximately 6,000 seeds make up 1 kg, and seeds are collected directly from the tree.

For seed collection, the fruits of Santalum album are gathered fresh from trees older than 20 years, soaked in water, rubbed to remove the soft pulp, and then dried. The seeds lack a testa and are stored in polybags or gunny bags after drying. Pretreatment involves acid scarification with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) for 30 minutes, followed by washing in running water, or soaking seeds in 0.05% gibberellic acid overnight.

Two types of seed beds are used to raise sandal seedlings: sunken and raised beds, both performing well under different climatic conditions. The seed beds are formed by mixing sand and red earth in a 3:1 ratio, thoroughly mixed with nematicides like Ekalux or Thimet at 500 g per 10 x 1-meter bed. About 2.5 kg of seed is evenly spread over the bed, which is covered with straw that is removed once the seedlings start showing leaves. Sandal seedlings are susceptible to a fungal and nematode infection causing wilting, chlorosis, and root decay. The mortality rate can be controlled with the application of nematicides and fungicides. Fungicide Dithane Z-78 (0.25%) is sprayed every 15 days, and Ekalux solution (0.02%) is applied once a month.

When the seedlings reach the 4-6 leaf stage, they are transplanted into polybags with a seed of a primary host like Cajanus cajan, Alternanthera sessilis, Mimosa pudica, or others for better growth. Care is taken to ensure roots are intact during transplantation, and shade is provided for the first week. Watering should be done once a day, avoiding excess moisture. Host plants are pruned frequently to prevent them from overgrowing and hindering sandal growth. The polybag mix should consist of 2:1:1 ratio of sand, red earth, and farmyard manure. To avoid nematode attacks, Ekalux (2 g per polybag) should be mixed with the soil. Polybags should be shifted every two months, and grading is done every three months. Weeding should be done regularly.

Plantable seedlings, about 30 cm in height, can be raised in 6-8 months. The ideal seedlings for field planting are well-branched with brown stems.

Regeneration of sandalwood can be done through different methods. These include dibbling seeds into bushes, dibbling seeds in pits or mounds, and planting container-raised seedlings in nurseries. In open scrub jungles with bushes, seeds are sown during the monsoon. An instrument made from a bamboo pole is used to sow seeds at the base of bushes. The trench mound technique is also used for sandal, where a perennial host plant is grown along with sandal either in the mound or pit.

For planting container-raised seedlings in nurseries, pits of 50 cm³ are dug at a spacing of 4 m x 4 m. Healthy seedlings, preferably over 30 cm in height, are planted along with miscellaneous secondary forest species as host plants. This method has proven successful in many forest areas. The presence of a perennial host increases sandal growth, but without it, the plant shows stunted growth and eventually dies.

Heartwood formation in sandalwood trees generally begins around the age of 10-13 years. The exact trigger for this process remains unclear, but factors like gravelly dry soil, insolation, and elevation range (500-700 meters) create the right environment for heartwood formation. The oil content in the heartwood is highest in the root and tapers off towards the tip of the stem. Young trees (less than 10 meters in height) have heartwood with 0.2-2% oil content, while mature trees (15-20 meters in height) have heartwood with 2-6.2% oil content. The oil's quality is due to the high percentage of santalol.

Sandalwood trees are susceptible to various pests and diseases. One of the most important diseases is spike disease, caused by mycoplasma-like organisms (MLO), which can occur at any stage of tree development. As the disease progresses, the leaves become smaller, narrower, and fewer in number, resulting in a "spiked" appearance. In advanced stages, the plant dies within 2-3 years. The disease spreads sporadically and is transmitted by insect vectors. Although no permanent remedial measures have been prescribed, some insect vectors responsible for the transmission of spike disease include Nephotettix virescens. 

Sandalwood trees are also vulnerable to pests like Zeuzera coffease, Indarbela quardinotata, and Aristobia octofasiculata, which cause considerable damage to living trees.

Sandalwood is one of the materials being used from centuries and this tree is evergreen and reaches up to 13 to 16-meter height with a girth of 100 cm to 200 cm and is variable in habit, usually upright to sprawling.

While it takes about 10-15 years for these trees to mature and generate a significant income, they are a valuable asset due to the high price of sandalwood in the market. Sandalwood trees are known for their slow growth, but they yield high-value returns. The oil content in the wood becomes valuable once the tree matures, typically around 4-10 years. However, Jafar notes that growing sandalwood trees requires patience and proper care.

One of the biggest challenges faced by farmers in Bidar district is water scarcity. Jafar has mitigated this problem by using drip irrigation and securing dam water for irrigation. These methods help him efficiently manage the limited water resources available. The land is rocky and infertile, but through proper management and crop rotation, Jafar has turned this land into a productive farming area. He mentions that when sandalwood trees are well taken care of, they are resistant to pests and diseases, which has helped maintain the quality of his crops.

Jafar cultivates a special type of sandalwood known for its high oil content. He collects his own sandalwood seeds and propagates them, allowing him to expand his cultivation while reducing costs. He also grows red sandalwood, which has a high market value. As sandalwood trees are highly valuable, they are often targeted by thieves. Jafar has built fences around his plantation to protect his crops. He emphasizes that farmers should take responsibility for guarding their plants, as no external help may be available.

Jafar’s experience suggests that investing in long-term crops like sandalwood, which take years to mature but provide high returns, can be a smart move. However, this requires patience and careful management. A key lesson from Jafar’s farming model is crop diversification. Growing multiple crops ensures that if one fails, another can still generate income. Jafar advises aspiring farmers to approach agriculture with dedication and patience. By investing time and effort, farmers can overcome challenges and achieve success.

Jafar encourages farmers to take advantage of government nurseries and trusted plant sources to secure quality plants for cultivation, especially for high-value crops like sandalwood. While government support is available, Jafar emphasizes that farmers should take personal responsibility for their success. This includes careful management of crops, protection of resources, and investment in long-term farming strategies.

Sandalwood is a valuable crop that has gained popularity beyond its traditional growing regions. Although it can be cultivated in other countries, the soil quality plays a crucial role in its growth. Once planted, sandalwood requires minimal attention, but consistent care, including watering and fertilization, is necessary. Over time, as the plant matures, its value increases significantly.

Many regions have started promoting sandalwood cultivation, offering incentives and support from both the government and private organizations. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive information available to farmers, and the methods for growing sandalwood are not always well understood or effectively implemented.

To grow sandalwood, specific soil conditions are required. Once planted, the trees need nurturing over a long period, with patience being essential. Typically, sandalwood trees take several years to mature, and their value increases substantially as they age. For example, the value of the trees can grow significantly over the years, especially once they reach maturity.

The government has introduced initiatives to support sandalwood farming. A policy introduced in 2021 allows farmers to cultivate sandalwood, but obtaining permission can be a complicated process. It involves consultation with the forest department and compliance with specific regulations.

Sandalwood farming can be quite profitable. A mature sandalwood tree can be worth a significant amount, and with careful management, farmers can see substantial returns. The government also collects taxes from sandalwood sales, contributing to forest development. However, there are challenges, such as weather conditions (droughts and rains) and the need for proper protection against pests. Proper knowledge of how to grow and care for the plants is essential to overcome these challenges.

Farmers interested in sandalwood cultivation should seek out comprehensive information before starting. Understanding the entire process, from planting to harvesting, is crucial for success. Patience is also necessary, as immediate results are not expected, but the financial rewards can be significant in the long term. Additionally, sandalwood farming has environmental benefits, such as improving air quality, increasing biodiversity, and contributing positively to the ecosystem.

Sandalwood cultivation is beneficial to the environment and provides food for birds. It has significant demand in global markets, particularly in Karnataka, where the price is higher compared to other places. 

When planting sandalwood, it is recommended to space the trees 10 feet apart between rows, and the soil should be prepared using cow dung and other organic materials. Proper care is essential, including regular pruning and watering. Sandalwood generally does not require much water after the first few years. After the first three years, the plants face fewer diseases, but humidity can cause some issues. Fungicides and other preventive measures can help manage this.

The Karnataka government provides subsidies and support for sandalwood cultivation, and farmers can obtain seedlings from the Forest Department. The market for sandalwood is expanding, and there are plans to allow more freedom in selling sandalwood in open markets. The government has authorized farmers to sell sandalwood wherever they choose. However, the price of sandalwood fluctuates, and it can be higher abroad.

Sandalwood plants are prone to drying, especially in their early stages, but this can be mitigated with proper care. Drying of plants is a common challenge, and when this happens, replacement seedlings are used. Wind and rain can also affect plant growth, so protection is necessary. Some farmers are exploring new techniques, such as using silk, possibly a type of support material, to assist in growth.

There are discussions about using microchips or cameras to protect and track the plants, although this technology is still considered expensive. Farmers are optimistic about the future, as demand for sandalwood is expected to rise, especially with countries like China increasing their sandalwood production.

There is potential for creating various products from sandalwood seeds and other parts of the plant. The plan is to continue cultivating and growing the plants while preparing for future markets.

Sandalwood cultivation can be a profitable venture for farmers, especially when combined with other crops like Areca. The financial benefits are expected to improve as the market grows and technology advances.

The speakers emphasize the value of sandalwood farming, especially when it is supported by government programs. The government is seen as a key enabler, providing high-quality saplings and assistance to farmers. There is also a focus on the idea that mixed-cropping can improve farming life, and while cultivating sandalwood requires hard work, it is considered a good investment.

There is an ongoing call for the government to support farmers more effectively. This includes providing more information about subsidies and permissions for growing sandalwood, as well as ensuring that farmers receive fair prices for their crops. Some farmers express dissatisfaction with the lack of information and support regarding government schemes.

Groundwater management is another important theme. Some speakers suggest that growing sandalwood can help improve groundwater levels by encouraging deeper root systems that bring water from the earth. This also ties into broader discussions about afforestation and sustainable farming practices.

Challenges such as drought, the need for more fertilizers, and the struggle for proper compensation are mentioned. Despite these challenges, many speakers remain optimistic and encourage other farmers to join the movement.

The role of influential figures like Jaggi Vasudeva in inspiring farmers to take up sandalwood cultivation is highlighted. Farmers from regions like Hiriyur taluk and Chitradurga express their motivation and pride in following these inspirations to grow sandalwood.

The conversation also touches on sustainability, with farmers noting that focusing on biodiversity and organic practices could help maintain the health of the soil and plants. The importance of protecting the environment and ensuring future generations benefit from these practices is emphasized.

Farmers express hope for the future, particularly about the growth of sandalwood and its potential economic benefits. They appeal for better policies, market access, and more facilities to make sandalwood farming a more accessible and profitable venture for all farmers.

The speaker advocates for farmers to be given more freedom to manage and market their products. It is emphasized that farmers should have the right to add value to their products and create markets for them, which would help generate employment and contribute to economic growth. There is a plea for the government to be more liberal and allow the free operation of these industries.

There’s a call for the government to allow industries like sandalwood cultivation to thrive, but bureaucratic hurdles, such as the Forest Department and government regulations, prevent businesses from growing. The speaker requests the government to enable these industries to thrive by allowing value addition and marketing.

Sandalwood is discussed as both a valuable religious and medicinal substance. The speaker highlights its importance in worship rituals and mentions its medicinal properties, such as treating diseases linked to bile, including stomach, throat, and urinary ailments. Sandalwood is also noted for its ability to enhance skin radiance and reduce skin issues like acne and blemishes.

The speaker recommends the use of sandalwood powder in medicinal decoctions and bath water for its cooling effects. Sandalwood can be used internally as a remedy for various aches and pains or externally to improve skin health. The speaker also mentions the potential of sandalwood oil for treating skin diseases.

Sandalwood, especially red sandalwood, is grown in parts of South India, particularly in Karnataka. Areas like Kolar, Chikkaballapur, and Chintamani have seen significant growth in sandalwood farming. Sandalwood cultivation is becoming increasingly popular due to its high demand and market value, despite challenges such as diseases affecting the trees. The trees are cultivated using specific methods, such as drip irrigation, in fertile lands and are often planted alongside other crops like bananas. There is also an emphasis on selecting the right seedlings and understanding how the trees interact with the soil.

Red sandalwood is a rare tree found primarily in the Seshachalam forests of Andhra Pradesh and is highly valuable due to its medicinal and ornamental properties. The high price of red sandalwood is highlighted, with one kilogram of wood potentially costing thousands of rupees in the market, and an entire tree yielding several lakhs. The wood is smuggled, particularly to China, where it is used in traditional medicine and furniture production. The tree takes around 30 years to grow and yield valuable wood, but organic farming can speed up this process to some extent.

The high demand for red sandalwood has led to illegal activities, such as smuggling and illegal harvesting, despite government regulations and penalties for violators. The government allocates funds for the protection of these trees, but safeguarding such valuable resources remains a significant challenge. While sandalwood cultivation can be lucrative, it requires proper management and care to avoid over-exploitation, which can deplete these rare species.

The global demand for red sandalwood, particularly from countries like China, has resulted in extensive smuggling operations, making it a significant concern for conservation. In addition to red sandalwood, African blackwood is another valuable tree discussed. This tree, used for making musical instruments and furniture, is even rarer and more expensive than red sandalwood, with prices reaching up to ₹8 lakh per kilogram in international markets. African blackwood is primarily found in Africa and takes about 60 years to grow. Like red sandalwood, it is under threat due to illegal harvesting and smuggling.

The discussion also emphasizes sustainable agriculture practices and forest management to ensure that sandalwood cultivation benefits both farmers and the environment. Integrating biodiversity and intercropping with sandalwood trees can provide a more sustainable and profitable model for cultivation.
